# new-term-radar

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

A daily report of the names that are starting to surge in AI: new models, products, tools and repos, caught where they are said first, before they show up in keyword tools.

Built for people who make pages, posts or products around new terms: SEO for AI tool sites, newsletters, directories, anyone who wants to know about "Strata" or "Seedance" the day it appears and not two weeks later.

## Why

A new name leaves a trail, in this order:

1. A lab or a well-followed account says it on X; a model enters Hugging Face's trending list.
2. One GitHub repo takes off on its own.
3. Directories and competitors add pages for it; someone registers a domain for it and the site starts to rank.
4. Your own site gets its first search impressions for it.
5. Google Trends shows the curve, days or weeks later.

Keyword tools read step 5. This radar reads steps 1 to 4 every day and uses step 5 only to check itself.

One example it was built around: [Niko1221/Strata](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata) was created on 2026-09-24 and had 7,700 stars nine days later. People were searching "niko strata" from 9/26, while no second repo carried the name and no keyword tool listed it. A single repo gaining 800 stars a day is the whole signal, and it is public.

## What it reads

![How the radar works: six signals, a name judge, the keyword table with its page-one check, a daily report and a 14-day check; used from the command line, three Agent Skills, an MCP server or the pains command. What 0.3 and 0.4 added is purple and tagged NEW](docs/radar.en.gif)

Purple, tagged NEW: what 0.3 and 0.4 added (⑥ revenue, ⑦ Reddit asks, the page-one check, the format and ⚡ marks, the `pains` command).

| Signal | What it catches | Needs | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| ① X | Names the accounts in your list used for the first time in 60 days | AIsa key | $0.003 per account per run |
| ① Hugging Face | Models and Spaces (the demos people try) new to the trending top 50; quantised copies and a model's own demo grouped under the base name | nothing | free |
| ② GitHub breakout | A repo under 14 days old averaging 200+ stars a day, or +400 since yesterday; adds the search variants people use ("niko strata") | nothing (a GitHub token raises the rate limit) | free |
| ③ Sitemaps | Words that several new URLs on a site share and its older URLs rarely carried. The example config watches eight AI tool directories (toolify, aixploria, ai-bot.cn, opentools, dang.ai, clipfly, aitoptools, futurepedia) and four MCP and skill directories | the sitemaps you list | free |
| ③ New sites | Domains registered and first indexed in the last 90 days that already rank for 20+ keywords | AIsa key | about $0.13 per query, weekly |
| ⑦ Asks | What people ask for on Reddit ("is there an AI tool that…", twelve phrasings): a model keeps the requests and complaints an AI tool could answer and writes each job as people would search it; jobs with searches get the page-one check | AIsa key | about $0.12 a week |
| ⑥ Revenue | Products people pay for, from TrustMRR's verified revenue: the fastest growing ($500+ in 30 days) and the newest listings; one at $0 last time and earning now is called out first. Its own description goes to the keyword table as evidence | TrustMRR key | free, 6 requests, weekly |
| ④ Search Console | Queries your site got impressions for, for the first time (fresh data) | your own Google token | free |
| ⑤ Review | Each lead checked in Google Trends 14 days later, against its own baseline; hit rate and days ahead per signal | AIsa key | $0.0012 per search variant |
| Keyword table | For the day's new names: the generic search terms behind them (what people do with the new thing), each sized, checked for room on page one, and given a decision | AIsa key; [GoAnyAPI](https://goanyapi.com) key optional | about $0.18 a day for 5 names, $0.30 with GoAnyAPI |
| Name judge | A small model scores every term: the name of one specific thing, or a common word? | AIsa key | a fraction of a cent per run |

Prices are what AIsa charged in October 2026. With the example config (35 X accounts read three times a day, the keyword table for 5 names a day) a month costs about $15: $10 for the X reads, $5 for the keyword table. Read fewer accounts, or read them once a day, and it drops in proportion.

## The keyword table

A name is half of what you need. "SynthID Detector" has a short life as a keyword and belongs to Google; the job it does, "ai image detector", is what people keep searching, and nobody owns it. Each day the radar reads the new names once more and writes one table with both:

```
| Keyword | Type | Behind | New? | Est. searches/day | Started rising | Peak vs gpts | Peak day | Last 7 days vs the 7 before | Now | Page one | Decision |
| **photocraft** 🖼 | name | — | yes | 12747 | 2026-10-05 | 97 vs 3.1 | 2026-10-09 | — | still rising | — | **prioritize** |
| **claude haiku 5.5** | name | — | yes | 1863 | 2026-10-07 | 100 vs 23.7 | 2026-10-08 | ×6.0 | still rising | — | **prioritize** |
| **ai image detector** 🖼 | generic | synthid detector | no | 2537 | — | 87 vs 31.6 | 2026-10-04 | ×1.2 | flat | — | watch |
| **photoshop alternative** ⚠ | generic | photocraft | no | 244 | — | 61 vs 61.7 | 2026-10-08 | ×1.8 | flat | — | skip |
```

(a real run, 2026-10-12, shortened; the Page one column came later, see below)

How it is made (`radar/usecases.py`):

1. **Evidence**: the most-liked posts that mention the name (X advanced search) and, for a repository, its README.
2. **Phrases**: a model reads the evidence and writes the keyword an ordinary person would type for each job it sees people doing, with a quote that backs it. A phrase built on another product's name ("photoshop alternative") is kept and marked ⚠: demand often hangs on the incumbent, and whether to use someone's brand is your call.
   On the free web lane the radar also takes **Google Trends' related queries** for the name: what people really searched together with it. For SynthID Detector that gave "ai photo detector", "google ai detector" and "ai detector"; these rows carry 🔎. Queries that hold the name are listed as its long-tails ("photocraft download", "nano banana 2.1 vs pro"). Queries that are themselves the names of other rising things ("gpt image 2.5" beside "nano banana 2.1") are kept as leads of their own.
3. **Screen**: a second call scores how well the name answers each phrase, marks brands, and spots the names of other things; the loosely related ones are dropped. For Claude Haiku 5.5 it dropped all six proposed ("ai coding assistant", "github copilot alternative"); for SynthID Detector it kept all five.
4. **Volume + difficulty + page one**: the free web audit (`webtool.kd` — web.cafe's keyword page over a browser session, zero credits) returns monthly volume, a difficulty score, the page-one results with DR, and a link budget, all in one call per phrase. Phrases under `min_volume` are dropped; most are.
5. **Trends**, twice per row: the term alone gives the shape (new or not, the day it started rising, the peak, the last week against the week before, what it is doing now); the term beside a benchmark keyword (`gpts` by default) gives the size.
6. **Page one**, for the rows that would be acted on (eight at most): the same free audit already fetched in step 4 supplies Google's first page with each site's DR and visits, the difficulty score, and a link budget — zero extra calls (the paid SERP/DR/KD APIs are gone; nothing is paid per row). Homepages carrying the term's words mark who already builds for it (`kw_hit`, the free twin of the old `pages built` intitle count). `open` = three or more of the ten results sit on sites rated under 30, or difficulty under 20; `crowded` = none does and difficulty is 40 or more; `mixed` in between. Under the table it names the weakest site on page one, where a new page can get in, and what kinds of pages hold it (tools, lists, articles, videos, forums).

Searches a day are estimates. A generic term's come from its own Google Ads volume, moved to today along its own Trends curve. The benchmark is then sized from those terms, and a name, which has no volume data yet, is sized against the benchmark.

Decision: **prioritize** = rose in the last 30 days, still up, at least `min_daily` searches a day. **watch** = rose but smaller, too early to read, or flat with steady demand of that size. **skip** = fading, or flat and small. A `prioritize` whose page one is `crowded` becomes `watch ↓`: still rising, but page one belongs to strong sites. In a name's first week page one is still forming (news, the maker's own pages); the second reading three days later is the one to trust.

Marks: 🎬 video, 🎙 voice, 🖼 image says what the thing makes, the usual order of what visitors pay for (video > voice > image > text); leads of equal standing are sorted by it. ⚡ = a post with 1,000 or more likes walks through a manual workflow or rides a trend: a one-click tool nobody has built yet. Both come from keyword rules over the lead's own words and posts; on six known names (Nano Banana, Veo 3.1, Seedance 2.5, Claude Opus 5.5, ElevenLabs v4, Qwen Image 2.1) the format came out right for all six and ⚡ fired once, on a widely shared Opus 5.5 + Blender + Unreal walkthrough. Read the posts before acting on a mark.

Each name is read twice, the day it appears and three days later, because on announcement day the posts are announcements and no use shows yet. The generic terms are kept as leads and reviewed after 14 days like the names.

What to expect from it, from the first eight names we ran it on:

- **The names rose; most generic terms did not, within five days.** PhotoCraft, Claude Haiku 5.5 and SynthID Detector all climbed clearly. Of the generic terms behind them, one moved: "photoshop alternative" ran about 80% above its level in the US for five days after PhotoCraft appeared. The worldwide daily series the table reads showed almost nothing of it (2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2); a US daily series from another source showed it plainly. So a flat reading from the worldwide series does not prove a term did not move. With a GoAnyAPI key the bigger rows are read from the one-country series instead, where a rise is 1.5 times the earlier level held for three days; the same run then shows "photoshop alternative" as `still rising (US)`.
- The table's dependable use today is to tell you **which existing demand a new thing serves and how big it is** ("ai image detector", about 2,500 searches a day). Whether generic terms follow the names is what the 14-day review will show, and we have no result yet.
- For pure model releases (Claude Haiku 5.5, Nano Banana 2.1) the evidence was announcements and benchmarks, and the phrases proposed were weak ("ai coding assistant"). It works better for products and repositories that do one job.
- **Google Trends' last two days are not settled.** For unrelated terms they came back as 0 and then 100, which reads as a spike. Our first pass was fooled by exactly this; every reader in the code now drops those two days, and a rise must last two days to count.
- Google Ads volumes run about two months behind. Trends reads nothing reliable for terms under a few hundred searches a month.

### When a source is missing or down

The table is still written, but it gets thinner, and it says which part is missing:

| What happens | What the table loses | The line it prints |
|---|---|---|
| The web session has no related queries for a name | The 🔎 rows, the name's long-tails and the other names searched alongside, for that name | "Related queries failed for: …" |
| The web session's country series fails for a row | That row's `(US)` reading — the worldwide series is used instead | "Country series failed, worldwide data used instead: …" |
| AIsa's post search fails for a name (timeouts seen twice on 2026-10-13) | That name's posts. A repository still has its README; a model or product without one is left with the related queries only | "The post search failed; this run used READMEs and related queries only: …" |
| Neither posts nor a README for a name | Its generic terms; the name's own row stays | "No posts or README found for: …" |
| No lead that day is a thing with a name score of 0.8 or more | The whole table | "Nothing to read today…" |
| The free web lane is down or rate-limited (pool exhausted) | The whole table: volume, difficulty and Trends are not replaceable — the run stops with an error instead of falling back to a paid API | the error, in place of the table |

A thin table is not a quiet day. Read the lines under it before you conclude that nothing moved.

Set `"usecases": {"per_day": 0}` or pass `--skip usecases` to turn it off.

### ⑥ Revenue: what people already pay for

A product that makes money proves the demand behind it. With `TRUSTMRR_API_KEY` set (from TrustMRR's developer dashboard), the radar reads once a week (`revenue.weekday`, Monday by default) the 30 fastest-growing products with at least `min_revenue_usd` ($500) in the last 30 days and the 30 newest listings, and keeps what it saw. The newest listings mostly earn next to nothing yet; they are read to record where they start, so a product at $0 last time that earns past the floor now is called out first. Hidden listings ("Anonymous startup") are left out, and a company's legal name gives way to its site's name ("Talent Tech Global Limited" is read as gptproto). Each product's own description goes to the keyword table as evidence, so the table reads the job people pay for, not only the brand. Growth above 1,000% reads "up from near $0": on the first run most of the fastest growers had started from almost nothing.

TrustMRR's API terms forbid republishing its data and building public SEO pages from it. Use the leads for your own research; do not publish the list.

### ⑦ Asks: demand said out loud

Once a week the radar searches Reddit for a dozen ways people ask for a tool ("is there an AI tool", "I wish there was a tool", "how do I automate", in `asks.patterns`), keeps the posts of the last week with a score of 2 or more, and has a small model sort them: a request, a complaint, a shared solution, or other. For requests and complaints an AI tool could answer it writes the job the way a person would search it ("add b roll automatically", "convert slides to notes"). Jobs with at least 50 searches a month are listed with their posts and get the page-one check; each becomes a lead. Most asks are too specific to have searches yet: the first real week, 84 posts held 43 asks and only two had 50 searches a month ("best ai tool for research", from a 1,034-point r/PhD thread, and "best ai tool for coding"). So the best-scored of the others are listed too, as ideas rather than keywords. A month of posts read in a trial held a request for "an AI tool to convert PowerPoint lecture slides into notes", the same job a tool-site course uses as its worked example.

Posts are for your own research: quote them, do not republish them.

### ⚡ What tutorial viewers ask for

For up to three leads a day marked ⚡ (a widely shared walkthrough of a manual workflow), the radar finds the top tutorial videos for the lead (GoAnyAPI), reads their comments (AIsa, $0.001 a page) and has the model pull out what viewers ask for: the steps they find too hard, the "can this be done in one click". That list is the one-click tool. It needs a GoAnyAPI key to find the videos.

## Pain points: `python -m radar pains "ai headshot"`

What people complain about for a kind of tool, grouped into the gaps a new tool can fill:

- low-star Chrome Web Store reviews (1 to 3 stars) of the extensions Google shows for the keyword, or of the ones you name with `--extension ID` (GoAnyAPI: 2 credits to find them, 3 a page of reviews);
- Reddit posts that complain about the job or its tools ("{keyword} alternative", "{keyword} frustrating", ...; AIsa);
- comments under the top tutorial videos for the keyword (AIsa).

A model groups them into gaps (missing, too hard, quality, price, wants a tool), each with a count, an example and the phrase someone with that problem would search. About $0.05 a keyword. Counts are of what was read, not of the market.

What it cannot read: App Store, Google Play and Trustpilot reviews (DataForSEO serves them as tasks to post and fetch later, and AIsa runs synchronous calls only); There's An AI For That's request board (a Cloudflare challenge in front of every page; getting past it would be getting past their bot protection, so the radar does not); Facebook groups (Meta closed the Groups API in April 2024, and its research library is open to approved academic and nonprofit researchers only).

## One key, plus a browser session

Post search and the name/phrase models go through [AIsa](https://go.aisa.one/yansen-zhu) or OpenRouter — one key, pay per call. **Every SEO metric — volume, difficulty, page one, Trends series, related queries — rides the free web lane** (`webtool`, web.cafe's browser-facing tools over an `ego-browser` session or a `WEBCAFE_COOKIE` login). No SEO API is called; if the free lane is down the run stops with an error rather than paying for a fallback.

> That link is a referral link: signing up through it supports this project. The radar works the same with a key from anywhere on aisa.one.

Without an AIsa key the free signals still run (Hugging Face, GitHub, sitemaps, Search Console); the report then lists every term unsorted, because nothing judges which are names.

## Quick start

Python 3.10 or newer. The radar uses only the standard library.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhuyansen/new-term-radar
cd new-term-radar
cp config.example.json config.json      # then edit: your X accounts, sitemaps, topics
export AISA_API_KEY=...                 # from https://go.aisa.one/yansen-zhu; or `aisa login` with the AIsa CLI
python -m radar daily --out report.md
```

The first run builds its snapshots: yesterday's X vocabulary, star counts and sitemap URLs do not exist yet, so only GitHub breakouts (which need no yesterday) are reported. From the second run on, every signal reports what changed.

Two commands:

```bash
python -m radar sources --out sources.md           # ① only: X and Hugging Face. Run every few hours.
python -m radar daily --skip x,hf --out report.md  # everything else, once a day
```

`sources` writes a report only when there is a new name. `daily` with `--skip x,hf` lists what `sources` kept in the last 24 hours. If you run only once a day, use `python -m radar daily` and skip nothing.

Other flags: `--skip` takes any of `x,hf,breakout,sitemaps,newsites,gsc,review,judge,usecases`; `--new-sites` runs the weekly signal today; `--mail` sends the report (below); `--state DIR` moves the database and snapshots.

## What a report looks like

From a real run on 2026-10-12 (shortened):

```
### Candidate new terms (names first; terms you already cover are marked)

| Term | Signals | Name score | Known | Search variants | Examples |
| **gridcraft** | GitHub breakout storytold/gridcraft ★3178 (626/day) | 0.95 | none | storytold gridcraft | GridCraft: an open-source, cl… |
| **artex** | GitHub breakout mhtsec/ARTEX ★3353 (825/day) | 0.85 | none | mhtsec artex, mht artex | AI 自主渗透测试系统 … |

Other rising terms (judged common words): anatomy, math, iphone use

### ⑤ Review (terms reported 14 days ago: did they rise in Google Trends?)

| Term | First reported | Verdict | Days ahead |
| strata | 2026-09-25 | hit | 3 |
```

and from `sources`:

```
| **qwen image 2.1** | Hugging Face: new at #4, 2 versions | 1.00 | none | Qwen/Qwen-Image-2.1-Turbo (text-to-image, ♥569) |
| **ltx 2.5** | Hugging Face: new at #6 | 0.90 | none | Lightricks/LTX-2.5 (image-to-video, ♥7347) |
```

`daily` also writes `report.json` beside the Markdown, with everything the report was built from.

## config.json

| Key | What it is |
|---|---|
| `lang` | `"en"` or `"zh"`: the language of the report |
| `x_accounts` | `labs` and `bloggers`: X handles to read. Labs say names first; pick the bloggers your field's new terms spread through |
| `sitemaps` | Sites whose new pages you want to see. `index` is a sitemap, or a sitemap index when `shards` (a regex) picks which sub-sitemaps to read. `pause` is the seconds between requests to that site. `strip_locale` drops `/en/`, `/zh-CN/` prefixes so one entry in many languages counts once |
| `topics` | Name and regex: each topic gets its own section listing the leads, repos and queries that match |
| `known_terms` | Terms you already have a page for, or never want reported. A lead that contains one, or is contained in one, is marked and not kept for review |
| `stop_words` | Everyday words of your field, added to the built-in list (which is tuned for AI tooling) |
| `judge` | `model` (any chat model on AIsa) and `min_score` (0.5) |
| `breakout` | `window_days`, `min_stars`, `velocity_min` (stars a day), `delta_min` (stars since yesterday) |
| `new_sites` | `queries`: a name and a SQL LIKE pattern on the domain (`"%ai%"`), one paid query each; `weekday` (0 = Monday) |
| `review` | `after_days` (14) and `per_day` (40 calls a day — local leads first, then the remaining budget pulls D1-side due terms from `$INGEST_URL/api/accuracy-due` when `INGEST_URL`/`INGEST_SECRET` are set; a `remote_attempts` ledger caps retries at 3 with a 30-day lapse) |
| `usecases` | The keyword table. `per_day` (names read a day, 0 = off), `model`, `benchmark` (the keyword sizes are compared with), `min_volume` (monthly searches a phrase needs), `min_daily` (searches a day for "prioritize"), `recheck_days` (3), `related` (use related queries when `GOANYAPI_API_KEY` is set), `related_geo` (`US`), `country_trends` (read the bigger rows' curves from that country), `country_min_volume` (1000) and `country_max` (8) |
| `gsc` | `site` (`sc-domain:example.com`) and `token_file`. Leave `{}` to turn the signal off |

Please read each site's robots.txt before you add its sitemap, and keep `pause` at or above its crawl-delay. The example config makes a few dozen requests a day in total, spaced by `pause`.

### Search Console (optional)

```bash
pip install google-auth-oauthlib
python scripts/gsc_auth.py gsc_client.json   # opens a browser once, writes gsc_token.json
```

`gsc_client.json` is an OAuth client of type "Desktop app" from Google Cloud Console, in a project with the Search Console API enabled. Then set `"gsc": {"site": "sc-domain:your-site.com"}`. The token is read-only and stays on your machine; `.gitignore` already lists it.

### Mail (optional)

`--mail` sends the report through [Resend](https://resend.com). Set `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` (an address on a domain you verified there) and `RADAR_EMAIL_TO` (comma-separated). `pip install markdown` for the HTML version.

## Use it from an agent: skills and an MCP server

### Skills

Three [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) live in `skills/`: one that does the whole job, and the two halves for those who want them apart.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `new-term-radar` | The whole run: today's new names, then the keyword priority table for them. Also takes names you already have. Start here |
| `ai-listening` | Collects what is new in the last 24 hours across the signals, deduplicated, as one report of names |
| `seo-new-keywords-research` | Takes names, or raw text that mentions them, and returns the keyword priority table: the generic terms behind each name, screened, sized and given a decision |

```bash
npx skills add zhuyansen/new-term-radar
```

In Claude Code the three skills also install as a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add zhuyansen/new-term-radar
/plugin install new-term-radar@new-term-radar
```

Then ask your agent for "today's new AI keywords", "an AI listening report" or "keyword research on PhotoCraft and SynthID Detector". The skills clone this repository to `~/new-term-radar` if it is not there, tell you the cost before any paid run, and say when a table is incomplete.

### MCP server

For clients that speak MCP (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop):

```bash
pip install "new-term-radar[mcp]"
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "new-term-radar": {
      "command": "new-term-radar-mcp",
      "env": {
        "AISA_API_KEY": "...",
        "RADAR_CONFIG": "/absolute/path/to/config.json",
        "RADAR_STATE": "/absolute/path/to/state"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Tool | What it returns | Cost and time |
|---|---|---|
| `recent_leads` | What the radar kept, with review verdicts and the hit rate per signal | free, instant |
| `keyword_table` | The keyword table for names you give it | about $0.05 a name plus $0.09 a call; 40 to 90 seconds a name |
| `run_radar` | One `sources` or `daily` run and its report | paid; minutes. For a first try: the schedule belongs in cron or Actions |

Point `RADAR_STATE` at the directory your scheduled runs write to and `recent_leads` shows their leads. The same two commands exist on the command line: `python -m radar keywords "name" …` and `python -m radar leads`.

## Run it on GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/radar.yml` runs `sources` every 8 hours and `daily` once a day, keeps the state in the Actions cache, and writes each report to the run summary. It is off until you opt in:

1. Fork the repository (a private fork is fine).
2. Remove `config.json` from `.gitignore` and commit your config. It holds no secrets.
3. Add the secret `AISA_API_KEY`; optionally `GOANYAPI_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `RADAR_EMAIL_TO`, `GSC_TOKEN_JSON`.
4. Set the repository variable `RADAR_ENABLED` to `true`.

## How the pieces decide

- **Names in posts** (`radar/terms.py`): capitalised words, words with a digit (`Qwen3.8`) or inner capitals (`HyperFrames`); a number after a name joins it (`Opus 5.5`). A name two accounts used counts; a name one account used needs 100 likes and must be unmistakably a name, since a capitalised word is often just the start of a sentence.
- **Surges in sitemaps**: counted per distinct URL against the site's own baseline, so one page with a long slug cannot fake a wave.
- **The judge** (`radar/judge.py`): one chat call per 25 terms, each with up to three places it appeared. If the call fails the report still goes out, unsorted.
- **The review** (`radar/review.py`): a variant "rose" when its peak after the day we reported it clears its own earlier baseline by 2x and by 10 points. A word with an older meaning ("strata": rock layers, property law) has a high baseline and does not count; "niko1221 strata" going from 0 to something does. Trends' unsettled last two days are left out.

## What we measured, and what we have not

- The name judge (`gpt-4.1-mini`) was run on 170 terms an earlier judge had passed as names in our own daily use. It agreed on 149. Of the 21 it rejected, most were noise the earlier judge let through (sitemap path fragments such as `io.github.wxt invoice`, `asd`); about three were real names it missed (`synthid detector`, `veo`, `v4.1 flash`), in a test that gave it less context than a real run does. It passed none of 40 common words (`dashboard`, `pricing`, `today`).
- Hit rates per signal: not yet. The review needs 14 days per lead and ours has only begun. The one seeded check, Strata, came back a hit, three days ahead of its Trends rise. Your own report shows your numbers as they accumulate; treat any signal as unproven until then.
- The X signal is only as good as the account list. It will not see a name none of your accounts says.

## Known issues

- **New sites (2026-10-12)**: AIsa's validation for `post_dataforseo_domains_whois_overview_live` currently rejects the filter format DataForSEO requires, so this signal reports an error and the rest of the report is unaffected. It worked until 2026-10-06. Use `--skip newsites` to silence it until that is fixed upstream.
- The built-in stop words and the Hugging Face name cleaning are tuned for AI models and agent tooling. For another field, add `stop_words`.
- Search volumes are not in the report. The radar tells you a name is new; check volume and the top results before you build a page for it.

## Development

```bash
pip install pytest markdown
python -m pytest -q tests
```

The tests cover the logic (name extraction, scoring, the store, the reports) and call no network.

## Thanks

- [子木 @CoderJeffLee](https://x.com/CoderJeffLee) for the idea behind the keyword table: a new name and the generic terms downstream of it belong in one table, each with a decision.
- [饭特稀 | Fentix @fantexi997](https://x.com/fantexi997) for [GoAnyAPI](https://goanyapi.com), the optional source of related queries and one-country Trends series.

The diagram is drawn by `docs/make_diagram.py` (needs `rsvg-convert` and `ffmpeg`).
